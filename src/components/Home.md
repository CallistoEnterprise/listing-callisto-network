# Listing

Soy Finance is committed to providing its users with the highest level of security possible. To achieve this goal, we have established the Listing, which is a list of all projects and assets that have undergone a rigorous preliminary security audit. This audit is conducted by a team of experienced security experts who use the latest tools and techniques to identify and assess potential vulnerabilities in the projects and assets that are being considered for inclusion on the Safelist.

The listing is the heart of all vetted project data in the Callisto ecosystem, as it keeps track of a wide range of data such as external URLs, images, and NFTs. This makes the listing an essential tool for managing and organizing the vast amount of data that is generated by the Callisto ecosystem.

The listing is shared across various platforms such as Soy Finance, Hub, Bridge, and many external projects, this allows for seamless communication and coordination between different parts of the ecosystem. It also means that the listing can be easily referenced by other projects, either directly or indirectly. This allows for a more efficient and effective management of the data that is stored within the listing, and ensures that all stakeholders have access to the latest and most accurate information at all times.

Overall, the listing is an integral part of the Callisto ecosystem, it acts as a central repository for all project data and provides a unified view of the different components of the ecosystem. This makes it a valuable resource for all stakeholders and is a key factor in maintaining the security and stability of the Callisto ecosystem.

## How to list your project

Requesting to have your project listed on Soy Finance's Listing is a quick and easy process. Simply head over to the <a href="/request">List new Asset Questionnaire</a>, fill out some details about your project, and submit the request. Our team of security experts will review the information provided and conduct a preliminary security audit to ensure that your project meets our high standards for security.

The questionnaire is designed to be user-friendly and easy to understand, so you don't have to worry about any complicated or technical language. It will ask for basic information about your project, such as its name, the team behind it, and a brief description of its purpose and functionality. You will also have the opportunity to provide any additional information or documentation that you feel is relevant to the security of your project.

We charge the following for new project listing:

- (required) $1000 security audit,
- (optional) $250 farm on SOY finance with multiplier 1.

The list of services will continually expand. If you want to request a higher farm multiplier, a specific service, or tailored support, please write this request in the respective field and we will contact you as soon as possible.

Once we have received your request, our team will begin the audit process and will get back to you within 14 days with the next steps. This could include additional information that we need from you, or an invitation to proceed with the next phase of the listing process. Our goal is to make the listing process as smooth and efficient as possible, while still maintaining the highest level of security for our users.
